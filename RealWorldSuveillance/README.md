### Motivation and contributions
Although the above-mentioned approaches are appealing, they are based on the approaches are appealing, they are based on the assumption that any pattern that deviated from the learned normal patterns would be considered as an anomaly.

However, this assumption may not hold true because it is very dirricult or impossible to define a normal event which takes all possible normal pattens/behaviors into account.

In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection algorithm using weakly labeled training videos.

This is we only know the video-level labels, i.e. a video is normal or contains anomaly somewhere, but we do not know where.
